# blog-API

https://roadmap.sh/projects/blogging-platform-api

I used DjangoRestFramework for this

To run it clone or copy this repository, move to the folder with cd blogAPI and run python manage.py runserver
  you will be in the DjangoRestFramework UI
  You can get a list of all posts by clicking the link shown in the ui or adding /blog in the url
  And also you can get a single post by adding /blog/2 to get the post with ID 2 in this case or you can filter by key words using /?search=key_word (replace key_word with an actual word)
